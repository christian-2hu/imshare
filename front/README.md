## Setting up

Go to ```src/app/environment```, rename ```environment.example.ts``` to ```environment.ts``` and put your RESTful path over there. The default images source folder is ```/images```, so if you change on the API, you should change here as well.

Before just run:
```npm install```
Then:
```ng build --watch```

It will compile the application on the ```/dist``` folder.
